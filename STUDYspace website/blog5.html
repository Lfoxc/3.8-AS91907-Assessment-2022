    <h2><span class = "outspan">19 August 2022 </span>- Changes to Pomodoro mode!</h2>
    <p>We have a brand new update regarding STUDYspace's Pomodoro mode. Originally, Pomodoro mode did not show much of a connection to its namesake technique. It was simply the fact that you timed yourself that we decided to call it 'Pomodoro mode', but it did not make use of the technique itself.
    The idea for Pomodoro mode was that you could choose a time of up to 45 minutes, and then choose websites for STUDYspace to block until the timer reached 0. In the original Pomodoro technique, the time you must set for yourself is 25 minutes with short break intervals in between. For the timed sessions, it is always 25 minutes.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Here at STUDYspace, while we still want to follow the steps of the Pomodoro technique we still want users to be able to choose a time that they wish for their chosen websites to be blocked. We have changed the idea of Pomodoro mode so that users can choose a time between 5-25 minutes along with the length of their rest breaks being between 5-15 minutes. This is to follow in line with the original Pomodoro technique making use of several 5 minute intervals
      and one long 15 minute interval after 3-4 studdy sessions. After the user has chosen the times, they will move onto choosing the websites they want to be blocked for their chosen time.</p>
    <div class = "image">
      <img src="images/break.jpg" alt="Page selection on STUDYspace's browser extension." id = "breakchoice">
    </div>
    <p>For now we do not have anything to stop the user from using the traditional Pomodoro technique, but in the future we might add an option within Pomodoro mode to follow the traditional Pomodoro technique.</p>
