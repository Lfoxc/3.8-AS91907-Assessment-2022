    <h2><span class = "outspan">18 May 2022 </span>- Welcome to our blog!</h2>
    <p>Welcome to our first blog post! As a part of the developmental stage of STUDYspace, we feel it is important to share our progress with all of you. This blog is
    our way of doing so. We will submit a new blog post whenever we have something to showcase, or if any changes are made to STUDYspace itself. <br> <br>
    It is here where we make our first big announcement: STUDYspace will not only be available as a Google Chrome Browser Extension, but as an app too! This is so that STUDYspace
  will be more flexible in terms of use. This means STUDYspace can be used on different devices (because browser extensions can only be used on computers, desktops, etc), it will
be able to block apps in addition to websites, and it will make use of accounts. On our Google Chrome Extension, we only intend for it to block urls and for storage to be kept on one device. This means
If the user accesses our browser extension on a different device, it will not show the websites you have previously selected or your chosen times. It also means if users use applications on their computers,
they may be prone to distractions. Our app will also make use of other features that will make your time with STUDYspace more productive and beneficial towards your learning. However, we only plan to release
STUDYspace as an app after releasing the browser extension and getting some feedback from that.</p>
