    <h2><span class = "outspan">15 August 2022 </span>- New mode announcement!</h2>
    <p>Hello STUDYBUDDIES! We thought that would be cute for some reason. As you have probably seen by the title of this blog, we have a new study mode! The name of our new study mode is... Exam mode!</p>
    <div class = "image">
      <img src="images/exam.jpg" alt="" id = "newmode">
    </div>
    <p>Looking at the screenshot above, you might have noticed that Exam mode is a timed mode, similar to Pomodoro mode. However, Exam mode functions completely different compared to our other current modes.
    Exam mode is meant to simulate real exam conditions. This includes the length of exams and access to resources during exams. One of the best ways to practice for an exam is to behave or work like you
  are in an actual exam. To people who get distracted easily this may be difficult as there is nothing stopping you from accessing your notes which you might not be able to view during an exam, or any other website.
Most exams last for several hours, with some having a minimum time in which people must remain in the exam room. If you are rehearsing for an exam of that length, then it might be especially easy to get distracted and lose
your workflow. Exam mode allows you to choose a time between 45 minutes and 3 hours (180 minutes), and all websites
except google applications will be blocked.</p>
