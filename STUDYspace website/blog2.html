    <h2><span class = "outspan">11 July 2022 </span>- STUDYspace Browser Extension first look!</h2>
    <p>Today we are delighted to share with you a sneak peek of the STUDYspace Browser Extension! Since we are still testing our extension, we obviously could not upload our extension to the web store. We are testing the STUDYspace Chrome Extension through the Chrome Extension's Developer mode. The image below is a screenshot of the landing/pop-up page for our extension.
    On this page, the user is presented with our two options: Manual & Pomodoro. Depending on their choice they will be transported to 1 of 2 pages.</p>
    <div class = "image">
      <img src="images/google.jpg" alt="">
    </div>
    <p>The site selection page is one the user will visit regardless of what mode they chose and is the page where the user will be able to choose what websites they want the browser extension to block. If the user has chosen the 'Manual' option, this will be the only step they will need to do in order to enable the extension to work. If the user chooses the 'Pomodoro' option, this will be the second of two steps.
    From here, all you have to do is decide when you want to unblock it, which can be done by clicking the puzzle icon next to the search bar.</p>
    <div class = "image">
      <img src="images/google2.jpg" alt="Page selection on STUDYspace's browser extension.">
    </div>
    <p>The timer selection page is only visited by the user if they click on the 'Pomodoro' button. This page allows the user to choose the time they want their chosen websites to be blocked for, and when they are done they will progress to the site selection page. The maximum time you can choose is 45 minutes while the minimum is 5 minutes.</p>

    <p>If you want to attempt to make your version of a website blocker browser extension, here are 2 useful video tutorials we found! The first video is a quick and simple tutorial, whereas the second video is longer and more complex.</p>
