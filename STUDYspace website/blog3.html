    <h2><span class = "outspan">31 August 2022 </span>- Mascot + Logo Competition</h2>
    <p>In case you haven't noticed, STUDYspace does not have an official logo! The most we have is the capitalised 'study' and lower case 'space'. As nice of a branding as it is, it is a little bit plain.
    Also, STUDYspace itself, and the way it is presented is also plain. We feel like there is no character to it. Sometimes it is good to use a mascot or ambassador to guide the user through STUDYspace's systems and features. <br> <br>

    This is why we are announcing a logo and mascot competition! Here is what you need to know:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The competition will last until 1st October.</li>
      <li>Give your mascot a name and a description!</li>
      <li>Your logo should be detailed yet simple and should accurately represent STUDYspace</li>
      <li>Your mascot and/or logo must make use of STUDYspace's colors (Hexcode: #FF6347).</li>
      <li>If you are designing both a logo and a mascot you can have your mascot be a part of your logo!</li>
      <li>Granted that STUDYspace is a student oriented program, your mascot or logo must not include nudity, violence or discrimination. Any logos or mascots that do this will immediately be disqualified.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Once you have completed your logos and/or mascots, please submit them <a href="#"><span class = "outspan"><span class = "inspan">here</span></span></a> along with your name & email address. We will show all appropriate entries on our Instagram and Twitter page, and will leave it up to all of you to vote for your favorite design.
    Winners will be notified before the final results are released and will be given a demo version of STUDYspace's Google Chrome Browser Extension.</p>
