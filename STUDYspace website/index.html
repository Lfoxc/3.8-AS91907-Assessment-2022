    <h3>What is <span class = "outspan"><span class ="inspan">STUDY</span>space</span>?</h3>
    <p>STUDYspace is a procrastination-prevention/productivity program which attempts to help students struggling
      to stay on track and tackle procrastination. Whether you decide to use our app or Google Chrome Extension,
      STUDYspace will allow you to study distraction-free by getting you to select the websites of your choice that
    pose the biggest threat to your productivity, which we will then block until you choose to disable it or until
  a time which is also chosen by you runs out. Scroll down to read more about the current modes that we have envisioned
for STUDYspace once it is released!</p>

    <h4><span class ="inspan">Manual</span> mode</h4>
    <p>The main purpose of using STUDYspace is to allow students to identify their
    biggest distractions in the digital world and take action to prevent these distractions
  from affecting their studies. Manual mode allows users to manually control how long they
feel they want to work distraction-free. Unlike the other modes, Manual mode only requires
one step to setup the website block, which is to simply choose which websites you want blocked.
Once the block is activated, users can choose when they want it to be disabled.</p>

    <div class = "time">
      <h1>10:00</h1>
      <button class = "btn">Start</button>

      <h4>This timer will start once the previous timer has finished!</h4>
      <h2>02:00</h2>

    <h4><span class ="inspan">Pomodoro</span> mode</h4>
    <p>The Pomodoro technique is a popular time management tool which is
      frequently used by people who struggle with distractions or procrastinates
      easily. Originally, Pomodoro mode was going to be loosely based off its namesake
      technique and would only make use of the time management component. However,
      while STUDYspace wants to encourage productivity we also want to ensure our
      users are not exhausting themselves. This is why we decided to stick with
      the original Pomodoro technique with one difference; the user can choose a
      time from between 10-45 minutes, with a break interval that takes the user's
      chosen time and divides it by 5. After the user has chosen a time, they will
    then move onto choosing the websites they want to be blocked for their chosen time.</p>

      <button class = "btn">Start</button>
      <button class = "btn">Pause</button>
    </div>
    <h4><span class ="inspan">Exam</span> mode</h4>
    <p>Exam mode is our newest STUDYspace mode concept. Similar to Pomodoro mode, Exam mode will require the user to choose a time of their choice. However,
      Exam mode will simulate real exam time constraints, meaning the user will only be able to choose a time between 45 minutes and 3 hours.
      Once a time is selected, STUDYspace will block all websites except for Google and it's applications to allow for zero distractions
    much like in real exams.</p>
