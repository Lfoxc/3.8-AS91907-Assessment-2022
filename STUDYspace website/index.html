    <h3>What is STUDYspace?</h3>
    <p><span class = "outspan"><span class = "inspan">STUDY</span>space</span> is a procrastination-prevention/productivity program which attempts to help students struggling
      to stay on track and tackle procrastination. Whether you decide to use our app or Google Chrome Extension,
      STUDYspace will allow you to study distraction-free by getting you to select the websites of your choice that
    pose the biggest threat to your productivity, which we will then block until you choose to disable it or until
  a time which is also chosen by you runs out. Scroll down to read more about the current modes that we have envisioned
for STUDYspace once it is released!</p>

      <label for = "check">Youtube</label>
    </div>
    <h3>Manual mode</h3>
    <p>The main purpose of using STUDYspace is to allow students to identify their
    biggest distractions in the digital world and take action to prevent these distractions
  from affecting their studies. Manual mode allows users to manually control how long they
feel they want to work distraction-free. Unlike the other modes, Manual mode only requires
one step to setup the website block, which is to simply choose which websites you want blocked.
Once the block is activated, users can choose when they want it to be disabled.</p>

    </div>
    <h3>Timed modes: Pomodoro & Exam mode</h3>
    <p><span class = "outspan"><span class = "inspan">Pomodoro mode</span></span> makes use of the Pomodoro technique. The Pomodoro technique is a popular time management tool which is
      frequently used by people who struggle with distractions or procrastinates
      easily. In this mode, the user can choose a time of up to 25 minutes along with the length of
      their rest breaks between study sessions. After the user has chosen a time, they will
    then move onto choosing the websites they want to be blocked for their chosen time.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p><span class = "outspan"><span class = "inspan">Exam mode</span></span> is our newest STUDYspace mode concept. Similar to Pomodoro mode, Exam mode will require the user to choose a time of their choice. However,
      Exam mode will simulate real exam time constraints, meaning the user will only be able to choose a time between 45 minutes and 3 hours.
      Once a time is selected, STUDYspace will block all websites except for Google and it's applications to allow for zero distractions
    much like in real exams.</p>
