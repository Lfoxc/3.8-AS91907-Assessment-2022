      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p><span class = "outspan"><span class = "inspan">STUDY</span>space</span> is a procrastination prevention and productivity promotion tool which allows students to study distraction free.
      It's enough that - for those who do not enjoy studying - students have to fight against the urge to ditch their obligations, but once they actually put their mind to studying, they encounter more distractions compared to the external world.
    In the end, even the most focused students can fall victim to these distractions, and by the time they realise they have gone off task, several minutes of potential progress have already been wasted. What STUDYspace does is allow students to identify
  their biggest and most troublesome distractions and temporarily put an end to them. This is done either through a timer or of the user's own volition. <br> <br>
STUDYspace is brought to you by the same team who created <a href="https://lfoxc.github.io/2.4-AS91893-Assessment/" target = "_blank"><span class = "outspan"><span class = "inspan">DITCS</span></span></a>, a Digital Technologies help site created for Digital Technology students in NCEA. STUDYspace inc. is a New Zealand-based
organization which looks to help students with their studies. In the case of DITCS, it was helping to educate Digital Technology students. With STUDYspace, we want to encourage productive learning and allow you to perform to the best of your ability. In the future
we look to further strengthen your potential through our NCEA calculator, which allows you to upload your work, mark it against the assessment criteria to determine your current grade and provides feedback and keywords to strengthen your work. STUDYspace was first founded
as a result of the organization's head, Leijh Beale, suddenly suffering from frequent struggles to remain on task. It was here she first envisioned STUDYspace's 'Manual mode', which allowed her to block and unblock websites whenever she wanted. After noticing how often other
students around her would go off-task, she decided STUDYspace should be made to cater to the needs of all students.</p>
